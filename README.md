Hello, My Name is Ishaan
I am a Website Editior for my school's news paper and know a bit of python. I am currently taking AP CompSci Principals.
My favorite subjects in school are Maths and Science. An I am taking SompScience to hopefully boost my skills and strech what I can do in the feild of software engineering. I thing computer science will be a valuble skill in the future, and Im looking forward to using it in my career. I am an aspiring Bussiness man or Engineer. One project that would really like to be able to make are games like worldle or sudoku for our school newspaper's website.
