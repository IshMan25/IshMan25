Hello, My Name is Ishaan

This year I will be taking the Advanced Topics in Computer Science class at GA. Some goals that I would like to acheive this year with the help of this class are:

Objective 1: I would like to be able to better the community at our school by applying my knowledge of CompSci to problems or projects that can make our lives easier.

Key Results:
- At roation 6-7 I would like to formulate ideas for impactful projects and also consult members of the community
- Consistantly communicate with those who the project effects including the teacher to ensure a positive impact
- At the end of the project I would like to reflect on the ethical impact of the project
- At rotation 18-21 I would like to attempt to release the projects and introduce them to the community

Objective 2: I would like to gain more comfortability with a more professional use of Computer Science rather than the classroom enviroment I am used to.

Key Results:
- Through rotations 1-6 I would like to interact with some of the more professional systems in computer science
- Through rotations 7-9 I would like to gain experience consulting members of my community to gain insight into problems
- Through rotations 7-9 I would also like to gain experience planning out my ideas before starting the coding

Objective 3: I would like to enjoy the experience of learning in this enviroment while also being able to have a challenging experience.

Key Results:
- The level of my coding ability by the end of this year should be noticably better than that of last year's
- By enjoying my learing experience, I should see that I am able to complete my goals on time
- In order to enjoy this experience I would like to communicate more with my teacher this year
